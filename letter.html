          Hey you,

Happiest Birthday! 🎂💫

On your special day, I just want to wish you all the love, laughter, and peace in the world 💖 You truly deserve every smile that life can give — may this year be filled with happiness, success, and moments that make your heart glow ✨

And now, let me take you back a little… from where it all started 🕰

It all began back in class 8, when I first saw you — that quiet, gorgeous girl with those beautiful dizzy eyes and that perfect smile 😊 Maybe that’s when my heart decided to stay with you — even before I realized it ❤

Then came class 10, and that one moment I can never forget — my birthday. You were about to leave the class, and something inside me just wouldn’t let you go without doing something. I ran behind you, stopped you at the door, and handed you that chocolate 🍫 — not expecting anything, just wanting you to know… you mattered to me. You still do 🥹💞

And then last year happened — when I finally told you everything I’d felt for years 💌 The bond we shared, the time we spent, the way we supported each other — so many moments that meant the world to me 💫 Wishing you the best year ahead, full of joy, laughs, and happiness 😄 — and I hope I’ll still be a small part of it 🤍

I know things changed later — we had our ups and downs, words that hurt, and moments that faded 💔 But no matter how far things go, I never managed to stop caring. Somehow, I always find myself coming back — because my heart still belongs there… with you ❤

Coming to the photo on the first page 📸 — it’s a reminder 😜 neku alane photo tiyadam radu ga, nerchuko ela teyalo! 😂

So, today on your birthday, I just want you to remember —

💫 I’m always here with you.
💫 I’m not here to erase your past, but to face everything with you — your past, your pain, your stories, everything you’ve been through.
💫 I’m here to help you heal, to make you smile, and to stand by you — always 🤍

You’ve been my favorite person since then, and you always will be 💖 Happy Birthday once again, my KitKat 🍫🥳🎂💐 Cheers to another year full of smiles, peace, and love 🥂✨

Stay the same — sweet, charming, and full of light 🌸

— With love, always,
Koushik 💫`;
